FunctionCalls:
- Automatically add bootstrap code
  - translator throws and exception if Sys.init file is not present)
  - doing this should be overwritted with a bootstrap: false option for backwards compatibility
  
- VmTranslator doesn't take a file, it takes a directory and translates all .vm files in the directory
  
x Line parsing needs to recognize these commands

- function declaration
  x create a label in the assembly
  x make sure that translator internals are aware that translation is happeneing within a function (for other labels)
  x Modify label to add in a function name if it needs to
  x Clear out values at LCL arg.size.times
  
- call 
  x see details on p 163
  x will need unique return address label with a class instance counter
  x can probably build this reusing lower-level push/pop stuff already written
  
- return 
  x see details on p 163
  
  
UP NEXT:
 - Working on accepting multiple files. Just made it so that each line instance is aware of the file name it's in. However, running `rspec ./spec/ecs_chapter_08_spec.rb:17` still fails.  Something is wrong with the assembly and the cpu emulator won't run the script
